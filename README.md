# Predicting NBA Player's Minutes Played Using a Ridge Regression Algorithm 

#Description

This project aims to predict a players average minutes played based on their college statistics, draft combine measurements and draft position. This is done is three main steps: 
1. Scraping the appropriate data (Scraper.ipynb)
2. Cleaning data (Cleaner.py)
3. Constructing a Ridge Regression Model (Regression Model.pynb)

A Detailed Guide to this project can be found in the Regression Model Jupyter Notebook
